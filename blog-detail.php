                            <p class="blog-desc-para">When it comes to cybercrime, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) have a growing target on their backs. Bad actors identified the vulnerability of these organizations with limited resources and underdeveloped cybersecurity policies. Furthermore, these smaller entities are often seen as gateways to larger organizations within the supply chain, making them potentially lucrative targets for attacks.</p>

                                <p class="blog-desc-para mb-0">To shed light on how these trends are playing out within SMBs, LastPass recently polled more than 600 business and IT security leaders from companies with fewer than 3,000 employees. </p>
                                <p class="blog-desc-para"><span class="text-decoration-underline">The survey revealed a concerning pattern:</span> while SMB leaders are becoming more proactive in their approach to cybersecurity – increasing awareness of and investment in security measures, for example – respondents identified that human factors are still creating serious security gaps that can leave these organizations vulnerable from cybercriminals.</p>

                                <p class="blog-desc-para">The most salient phenomenon the survey identified is the accountability disconnect between executive actions and employee behaviors. </p>
                                <p class="blog-desc-para">Executives are increasing their focus on and investment in cybersecurity, with 90% of IT leaders and 80% of non-IT leaders reporting an increased focus on cybersecurity measures over the past year, and 82% of businesses boosting their cybersecurity budgets.</p>
                                <p class="blog-desc-para">In turn, 92% of executives and 93% of IT leaders reported believing employees understand security expectations. And the majority of executives and IT leaders reported feeling confident about their cybersecurity measures, with only 30% of leaders believing their company faces a high risk of cybersecurity issues.</p>
