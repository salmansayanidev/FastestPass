                        <p class="list-para text-gray">Weak passwords are very easy to track. Brute force is a method used by hackers that is predicated on the notion of attempting to guess a user's password without any guidance. Usually, it's a computer program that attempts various words until it finds the right one. To make it function, hackers only need to upload a database containing dictionary words, commonly used passwords, or password leaks from the past. Consequently, the harder a password is to guess, the less likely someone is to figure it out. Password checks are one of the best ways to make sure your passwords are strong.</p>
